# International Space Station Tracker

In this Flask-based project, I developed a web app that tracks the live position of the International Space Station (ISS) and identifies the country and weather conditions below it. I integrated data from multiple APIs, including those for ISS coordinates, weather data, and country flags. The app also calculates the ISS's distance from my current location. This project demonstrates my ability to merge data from various sources and present it clearly to users.
## Features
- Retrieves current ISS coordinates (Open Notify)
- Shows weather at that location (OpenWeather)
- Detects the country underneath and displays basic info + flag (REST Countries)
- Calculates distance from my location (set in code)
- Data refreshes on each page load

## Tech
Python, Flask, Jinja2, HTML/CSS, Open Notify, OpenWeather, REST Countries APIs
